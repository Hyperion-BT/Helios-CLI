# Heph

Heph is the main CLI for using the Helios programming language.
It's currently in early development and has only primitive features (compiling helios files).


The long-term plan is for Heph to be a build system, akin to Cairo's [Nile](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/nile) or Rust's Cargo.

### TODO

- [x] Create projects with `heph init <project-name>`
- [x] Compile projects with `heph compile`.
- [] Add testing with `heph test`.
- [] Add contracts to project using `heph add <script-purpose> <contract-name>`.
